Some sample code from my Zero Nights 2017 presentation on UAC bypasses using
Windows access tokens.

Consists of two parts. 
* bypass_uac - This bypasses UAC when in admin approval mode by using token impersonation (including Win10)
* ots_auth - Abusing OTS elevation and enterprise domain auth to access a resource.
